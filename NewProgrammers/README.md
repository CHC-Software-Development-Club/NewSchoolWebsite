# New Programmers Guide

Oh Hello! I'm assuming since you are here, you are new to programming. This is a cheat sheet. 

During this year's club, we will be working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (And React). DONT WORRY ABOUT BACKEND! People with knowledge will be working on that along side working with you (the brave soul wanting to learn).

# HTML
- Concept:
 Html is what the the webpage interperates. If you open inspect element, that is HTML. Think of it as directions to a LEGO set. The website interprets it, and builds it. 
 
One MAJOR part of this is elements. An element is a "part" of a project. Think of it like a periodic table element. They each have their own function. That's the same with HTML elements. They each make up a part of a webpage.

Below I put a table of common HTML Elements, which is INCREDIBLY useful for very new HTML programmers. Don't worry. This language is fairly easy.

```
<html> #This declares the file an HTML file. 
<div id="Hai> #This declares a section or "division" of the code
<p>Hello World<p> #This is the paragraph element (It is for well... a paragraph!)
</div>
</html> #The Slash ends any element
```
