If you were confused at all during the meeting today (Wednesday September 18th), do not worry. It was a conversation about dependencies, which are tools we will use to make the website. If you are new to programming, this can be intimidating. DO NOT WORRY THOUGH! I will be sure to take next meeting to clear everything up and catch up anyone new.

If you couldn't attend or were doing something else while there, here are some things you WILL need for the club.

(Note: will update schedule here)

Club Planning Info:
---------------------------
- September 23rd Meeting: Teach New Programmers Javascript, and learn the framework all together. Possibly divide up into different teams from experience.
- September 30th Meeting: Get started on project (Set up express server and get port listening, Basic Database if time allows)

Software:
-----------------------------
- Visual Studio Code (Get the Live share extension too if you can)
- Gitbash (For pushing your work to the github so we can all be up to date)


Events:
----------------------
Nico brough up that fall fest is important for funding. We can decide to do this or not. Up to everyone.
