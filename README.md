If you were confused at all during the meeting today (Wednesday September 18th), do not worry. It was a conversation about dependencies, which are tools we will use to make the website. If you are new to programming, this can be intimidating. DO NOT WORRY THOUGH! I will be sure to take next meeting to clear everyone up and catch up.

If you couldn't attend or were doing something else while there, here are some things you WILL need for the club.

Software:
-----------------------------
- Visual Studio Code (Get the Live share extension too if you can)
- Gitbash (For pushing your work to the github so we can all be up to date)
