# New School Website
Notes:
---------------------------
- I made a new programmer file. I will create a basic React enviroment in there to mess around with. FREELY use it. It is for you and no one else. Play around. Have fun. This is what the club is all about. Enjoying programming together.

Club Planning Info:
---------------------------
- October 28th: Depends on how back end is looking. Most likely more front-end work, but mixed with backend
- Meeting X: Front End
- Meeting Y: Front End (Possible Back End Intro)

Software:
-----------------------------
- Visual Studio Code (Get the Live share extension too if you can)
- Git (For pushing your work to the github so we can all be up to date)
