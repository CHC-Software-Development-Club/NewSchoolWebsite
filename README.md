# New School Website
Notes:
---------------------------
- I made a new programmer file. I will create a basic React enviroment in there to mess around with. FREELY use it. It is for you and no one else. Play around. Have fun. This is what the club is all about. Enjoying programming together.

Club Planning Info:

- (Break): I will be working on this as I do not do much with my family
- December 2nd: Lets try to wrap up the BASIC front page by now
- December 9th: Use the backend to add fuctionality to front page
